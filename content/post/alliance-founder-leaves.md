So, you started a Travian alliance and you want to quit? So, you need to know what happens when the alliance founder leaves the alliance. Maybe your the co-leader, and you want to bump off the alliance founder. Maybe you just want to quit the alliance and move to the World Wonder meta-alliance.

The boys and I have done some testing, and this is how it works:

The alliance founder may be special because he holds the embassy, and started with all the privileges, but the founder is no different from any other account in the guild. If you give “assign position” to another player, he can use those rights to remove your privileges, or even kick you from the alliance you have founded! So, be very careful giving rights out. Reserve “assign position” for yourself. No one else should need this, unless of course you want to leave, or become inactive. If the founder of the alliance deletes, or quits, nothing happens.

That’s right if you quit, no one will even notice. Just make sure you gave “assign position” to someone else in the guild, because then they will have full control over every aspect of the guild. If the founder quit and gave no one “assign position” well then you’re all out of luck.

The number of players an alliance can hold is based on the **largest** embassy in the group. This embassy need not be the founder’s! If you get tired of building the embassy, make someone else do it. Delegate the task to a good Teuton player who can afford it. As long as he doesn’t have “assign position” he has no extra power except that he can destroy the embassy, and force you to rebuild it.

If your embassy is catapulted, you do not lose any players. You simply can’t add new players until you rebuild it.
