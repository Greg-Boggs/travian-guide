Travian analyzers are used to track population growth, conquers, rank movements, and much more.

While many players have seen these tools, few realize the value they serve to yourself and to an alliance leader. The analyzer’s main use for a recruiter is to determine whether a prospective recruit just had a rough start, or if he’s just a dead weight farm looking for protection. Analyzers are great for checking on the activity of potential farms, inactives are really obvious even if they log in once in a while, you’ll be able to see they almost never build! The TSU analyzer also has a poor man’s crop finder.

If you are an alliance leader, you can punch in your alliance into the analyzer and get an overview of population growth and events for your entire alliance. You will quickly see why your top players are at the top, and those annoying inactive players are at the bottom… they simply don’t click on things. The analyzer allows you to go through someone’s history and see first hand just how inactive they were. When you boot someone, you’ll know you aren’t missing out on decent players.

Another useful aspect of the analyzer is to check up on other alliances that are at war. Pull up both alliances and check for red that will indictate players who have died recently. You can also flip to the events tab, and see if there have been any conquers. The analyzer will teach you that most wars in Travian are Cold wars with little real action.

While your in the events tab, you’ll see that Great players expand in a predictable time frame. 4-7 days after they start, a great player has 2 villages, within 12 days they have 3! Meahwhile, average players take 10-12 days for the second village and 15-16 for 3. Weak players, farms, will often go 21-30 days before founding their second village! If someone wants to join your alliance simply flip to events, if they haven’t made their second village in less than 12 days, they are a waste of your energy.

The last feature of the TSU analyzer is its “Crop View”. While not sufficient for finding all croppers in a game, it can be used to keep track of the croppers around your villages, so you can find where the heavy hitters are, and also see if any near by croppers can be taken.
