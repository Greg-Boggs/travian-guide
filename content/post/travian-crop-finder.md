I think you guys know what to do from here. A cropper, or high crop village is a must have for any successful Travian Empire. A 9 crop village gives you the ability to build a semi-large raiding force. But, the 15 crop village is ideal for a massive army. The top players will all aquire 15 crop villages within their first 4 villages. So, it may be difficult to find one at first. But, don't give up. It's possible to conquer these later on if you missed your chance.

So, you’ve found out what a “cropper” is, a village with more than 6 crop fields, and you realize you need one to support a huge army. But, how do you locate one? There are so many hexes and it takes forever to click on them all. The answer is simple. You use a crop finder. 

You could search hex by hex with your mouse, as I did to find my first cropper, but this takes hours, and your liable to miss villages right under your nose! The searching for croppers is a massive disappointment in The Travian interface, that makes the game incredibly hard to play. So, instead of cramping our sore wrists, we use automated tools to give us the information we need. There are many different types of crop finders.
