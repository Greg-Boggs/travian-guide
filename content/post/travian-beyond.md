Travian Beyond is a [Greasemonkey script](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/15943) that improves the interface of the game. It has more than 
**1 million** installs. The script does not send any commands to the server, and does not cheat for you. All the script does is fix several very annoying bugs and short comings in the user interface. For example, 99% of the time you attack, you want to raid. So, raid should be the default option. However, Travian’s inactive programmers have left “reinforce” as the default option. This flaw, forces an active player to create hundreds of extra clicks every single day. Travian beyond fixes this by setting the default option to raid rather than reinforce. Use Travian Beyond to conduct one farm run, and you’ll never understand why the programmers of Travian don’t fix this interface bug.

Travian Beyond also has several other key features. It gives you access to the “note pad” from the main overview screen, as well as showing you graphically what level all your buildings and resource fields are without forcing you to click or hover on them. Beyond also has many, links built into it that make the game more fun. Have you ever wondered why the combat simulator is so hard to get to? Or why you have to make so many clicks to get to your alliance overview? How about trading, raiding, or the rally point… all of these things are 1 click away from the overview screen with Travian beyond. While multihunter will tell you creating a webpage of links is cheating.

It also includes a battle analyzer, however it is not as powerful as the battle analyzer made by travilog. So you’ll want to use both scripts when playing Travian. The newest version is most likely not detactable by MH because the images are now all grabbed from a lycos server, but the old version did get many people in trouble. To my knowledge no one was banned for it, but that could change in the future. Travian beyond is used by almost all of the game’s top players, and no world wonder holder would ever leave home without it, simply because it makes transfering resources take fewer clicks.

Travian Beyond does not farm for you, and it does not build for you, so we don’t think its cheating. Its simply using an unmodified firefox to access the game. The script does not send anything to the game, nor automate any actions. It does not tax the server in anyway. In fact its main purpose was to repair Interface problems that the Travian programmers are too lazy to fix. In most player’s opinion Travian beyond should be built into the game.

> “§5 Use of externals
>
> The use of scripts or bots which automate actions (such as building upgrades, building troops, sending troops, trading, developing researches, attacking alerts or crop finders) or modify the game interface (for example, grease monkey scripts) are against the rules. The game must be played with an unmodified internet browser. All scripts which excessively tax the server are also forbidden.”

Everything Travian Beyond does is local to your computer, and any software you run or write on your own computer is your business, not triers. No one can dictate which software you install or run on your machine, only wither or not you use a bot to interact with their server. So long as you do nothing to harm the game, you’ve done nothing wrong. Further reading below. That being said past users of the script have been banned so use it at your own risk. It is considered cheating.
