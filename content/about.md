I started this after playing several Travian rounds because I found myself collecting Travian related resources and materials on my desktop. As I spent far too much time trying to teach others how to play well, I decided it was time to share some of the resources. Every time my allies fell behind, I would spend 20 minutes rounding up as many howtos and tips for Travian as I could find. As a diplomat this activity has become a full time job. Never mind what happens to your time when you become the leader of a multi-wing alliance.

Travian Guide pulls together years of experience and information learned from various places including: wikis, forums, and tools sites. This site is the only link I will ever have to give out again. Not only does it contain links to many hard to find and obscure Travian resources, it also contains unique guides written by a handful of Travianâ€™s best players. It is a repository of information for alliance leaders and new players alike.

I hope you find the information as useful as I have over the years. If you have suggestions for the guides or additional links for the site, your comments and feedback are always welcome.
