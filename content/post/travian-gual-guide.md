So, you read my [Travian Roman guide](travian-romadn-guide). You take full advantage of the club swingers fast movement, cheap cost, and quick production time to crush everything around you. However, that was last round, this round you got jealous over fast calvary, and lightning quick defenders, and chose to start as Gaul. Now how the heck do you survive against that Teuton punk next to you? If you were Teuton, you’d have his club swingers beat 3 to 1… but your stuck with Gaul so now what?


While farming is the most important aspect of Travian, it is even more important to farm as a Gaul. Your raiders aren’t cheap, and they aren’t as quick to produce, so you won’t be able to make 150 units on your first day of raiding like you could with club swingers. **A Gaul player can get a heavy boost from Resource bonuses and NPC trade.** But, lets look at Gaul’s advantages.

1. Fast easy to produce defenders

2. Double Cranny

3. Traps

So to start as Gaul you’ve got to rely on these three things. And make sure you raid only INACTIVE players. Rather than producing a barracks on your second day, hold off until the third day to give your neighbors a chance to quit the game and go inactive before you farm them. Make sure you have a level 8-10 cranny, and a level 1 trapper right out of new player protection. If you have stupid Teuton neighbors, they will send in 2-3 club swingers and get them trapped. You can then add another level to your traps, and produce 5-10 phalanx. By the time he comes back, you’ll smack his poor raiding force, and he will be sore. However, a good Teuton rival will first raid all the Romans, and Teutons, and not come for you until hes got enough numbers to ignore traps.  If you play actively your population should scare him off. but If it doesn’t he will raid you, and get his clubbies trapped, gain zero resources, and find you very annoying. Make sure you keep your phalanx safe from him, and use those double crannies so he always gets zero resources from you. Its VERY important not to give an inch, as you’ll be applying to a strong alliance soon, and stolen resources make you look weak. Instead you want the alliance leader to see your collection of phalanx and a string of worthless raids.

While Phalanx are poor raiders, they are great defenders, You should start making these as soon as your resources are level 4. 15-30 phalanx are plenty to clean out the inactives around you, and allow you to push for TT. These quick calvary are the fastest raiders in the game. Remember to be EXTREMELY careful, an active Roman with 4-5 legionnaire will ruin all your fun, even after you have TT, so make sure you only hit inactives.  Its crucial that you get into a good alliance soon, so push hard to collect 10-12 TT, and keep raiding with those phalanx. If your being hit by a Teuton, and haven’t made any friends yet, you should consider buying some gold to use NPC trades to create resources. set 1-2 market trades Wood for Food, then NPC food into Wood… you can make 20,000 resources easily, giving you the boost you need to produce settlers, or create more TT.

If you’re being heavily pressured by a Teuton, TT are his worst fear, so protect them at all cost, once you have a TT hero, and 10 TT you can really hurt him by clipping his clubbies. 10 TT with a hero can massacre even large Teutonic armies at this point in the game almost no one has spear fighters.

Wipe your neighbors army and watch them come running for an alliance.


 

By 8 days into the game you should have your second village going (preferably a 6 cropper) and you’re game should be moving along nicely. You’ll be pushing your way towards 50 TT and any Teutons around you, will hate you by now. Give the alliance you want to join a travilog of some of your hits, or just tell him to check your offense score. Good alliance leaders will be excited to find a Gaul with offense points and floored by your “skillz”

At this point push your traps to 50-60, this will make you invulnerable to roman and other Gaul players. If a Gaul your size tries to raid you, hes going to get his entire army trapped, and your phalanx are going to massacre those poor TT. If a roman tries to hit you… his legions are going to be hard pressed to beat your traps and your phalanx… but if a large pop Teuton tries to raid you… dodge them!

If you can manage a top 500 start with a Gaul, your a serious committed player any alliance will be happy to have. Just realize, getting there with a slow to start faction is hard work. You have to do a lot of small raids using phalanx, and you’ll find swords slow and expensive compared to those clubbies you love. But, once you have 200 TT, and you start clearing clubbies 500 at a time, you’ll be happy you decided to play Gaul. If Gaul isn’t your thing, then read my Roman guide.
