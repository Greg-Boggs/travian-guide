Travian web-based tool sites, offer many simple tools to make playing Travian easier.

* [Travian Tool Box](http://www.traviantoolbox.com/en/)
* [Travian Tool](http://www.traviantool.com/en-US/)
* [iTravtools](http://itravtools.com/)

Many of the tools are neat, but only a few are indispensable. My most frequent use of tool sites is to find good farms, or to get an overview on player distances in a war.

The full range of tools available from these sites differ slightly from site to sight, but here is a list of the tools from each site. From the toolbox I most often use the battle plan tool because its extremely helpful in assigning war targets. Tool sites often provide mapping tools as well, but dedicated map tools are much more powerful for mapping players.

* Troop Comparison
* Combat Simulator
* Distances and time
* CR converter
* Players Signatures
* Calculators
* Graphic packs
* Map
* Lists
* Battle Plan

#Travian Tool

From Travian Tool I most often use the inactives tool to find farms. Neighbors is also a decent tool, and the statistics are quite fun when your bored, but for statistics its best to use world analyzers.
