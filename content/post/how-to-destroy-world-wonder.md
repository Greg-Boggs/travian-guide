“I have a big alliance I will attack them until they are all dead. Then I will attack them more!”

That will not get you far. If the enemy is over 5 hours away, It takes far to long to kill even 1 account. By the time you’ve gotten even 1 kill, the game will be long over. C.H spent 2 solid months trying to kill my single account last round at a range of 6 hours, and by the reset they had managed to only dent my population. If you want to prevent  someone from winning, and your serious about it, there are only a few paths:


1. Build hammers with 5000+ level 20 catapults and wait for your enemy to go for a win, when they do you strike their WW, with your entire army. If you have just enough men, you’ll set them back several levels.

2. Strike the main supporters. Break their will to play Travian by conquering outliers. This only works if your lucky enough to be close to the enemy. If you can get even 1 player to give up the game without having to kill him, you’ve damaged their chance. Most alliances carry many high pop unimportant players that they will use as buffers. The alliance will happily let you eat your fill of conquers to keep you busy on unimportant players while the real shakers win the race.

3. Strike at the main food providers. There are many 15 croppers, but a non capital 15 isn’t worth that much at all. Good WW players clear out their capital army so it produces 200,000 crops per hour. These offensless players become the backbone of feeding the world wonder. Take out those crop fields, and the food grinds to a halt, You can also target TO’s and Market places from key towns.

3. Strike the support villages that are being used to pool reserve food. Last round 1 player K00jo managed to get off hundreds of cata waves simply by always using equal fakes on all villages each target was always hit with 5 waves… 24 would be faked, 1 would be real… half the time all 25 would be fake. He’d hit once, go for my crop fields and main building, and then switch, sometimes to a different target.

You must hit them like this every single day, Twice per day. The more players you have that can do this, the better your odds, if they can predict any attack and kill the clearing army, the fight is over and you’ve lost. In the end K00jo lost last round, because I clipped all his catapults so many times, he simply ran out of will to build more.

You cannot win by killing their solders, you can only win by killing their food, because food income per hour is the limiting factor on a wonder, not the number of soldiers it has. Soldiers almost always out number the amount of food the care givers can supply. Even if you can’t kill thier food, you can force them to send out mass defense requests which consumes tons of food. The more they have to send to the same account the better.
