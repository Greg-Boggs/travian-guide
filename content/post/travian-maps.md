There are many maps of Travian, and I will not attempt to make a comprehensive list of mapping sites. Instead I will simply give you links to a couple of my favorite map tools. Most are a bit hard to use at first, as they are often case sensitive for no reason. But once you get the hang of them, they are a great when organizing alliance wings. or when deciding where to found new villages.

Personally, I prefer Travian Map because it has more features, however, it is harder to use. Travian Map will zoom in easily (although not out). It will allow you to hover over a dot to find out who that dot is, and It has several advanced display features I never bother with. Yet, alliance names are case sensitive so it is often very difficult to get all the alliances on the page, and its **extremely** difficult to find your server in the drop down lists of servers. This drop down problem is a huge weakness to the site.

While Travian map is a more powerful map, its interface weaknesses cause it to take longer to use, so when I want a quick and easy map, I visit Shishnet’s Travimap. Its lacking in the advanced features, but if you want a nice picture of your friends or enemies this map will take care of you.n by killing their solders, you can only win by killing their food, because food income per hour is the limiting factor on a wonder, not the number of soldiers it has. Soldiers almost always out number the amount of food the care givers can supply. Even if you can’t kill thier food, you can force them to send out mass defense requests which consumes tons of food. The more they have to send to the same account the better.
