Specifics:
* Sufficient time needed for offensive play.
* Inexpensive troops may be produced fast, good at looting.
* For aggressive and experienced players.

This Teuton guide will give you the basics of playing as an agressive looter. The Teutons have several important advantages that other players don't share. They can train units faster than any other tribe. Their troops are inexpensive, and they carry extra loot. These 3 elements combine to make Teuton the strongest early raiders.

While their troops aren't quite as strong as Roman's in the late game, the early game advantage in raiding can mean the Teuton player has a larger kingdom with more villages. Teutons excel at being the first to capture 15 crop villages. You can use a [Crop Finder](travian-crop-finder) to locate one early on in your game.
